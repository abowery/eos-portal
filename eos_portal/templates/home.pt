	<h1>We could cause a diplomatic crisis.</h1>
	<p>Take the ship into the Neutral Zone What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I am your worst nightmare! Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Besides, you look good in a dress. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Computer, belay that order.</p>
	<h1>Fate.</h1>
	<p>It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Your head is not an artifact! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?</p>
	<h1>Shields up!</h1>
	<p>Rrrrred alert! How long can two people talk about nothing? They were just sucked into space. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.</p>
	<p>Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Ensign Babyface!</p>
